Last five year of 21st century's 2nd decade introduced the world to the need of mobile app and the powerful message that's being delivered by them daily. People want apps on their phone, and they want more.

Designing an app that's not an eyesore on the homescreen is not easy. But when you're still a tiny little startup, you don't want to spend too much time developing an app that's nobody wanted. Just as Kevin O' Relly said, somebody outthere who has the resources, can come in and crush you like the corkroach that you are.

Luckily, the opensource world openned the whole new door for developers. The MEAN stack (stood for MoongoDB, Express.js, Angular and Nodejs) has served those who need to hackup a website, or webapp well. But what about mobile application?

Introducing, the PAIN stack!

PouchDB?

The reason is simple. PouchDB allow website to cache database, such that user can use the app with data they have previously downloaded **offline**! Furthermore, PouchDB is compatible with CouchDB, the very database that's powerful with replication abbility. As developer, you really don't want to miss out on this.

Angular!
