# Why?
### Or the purpose of this whole thing...

First if you have to choose a static blog engine vs a server-client kind of stuff, where the client here is you (not the reader btw), then you will be screwed the moment your connection is gone. Wordpress and Blogger [TODO: Fact check] both require some connection, so you better be really want to spend money on that piece of connection (4G).

Or you can just do static blog, which offers the following:

  + Everything can be done offline on your laptop
  + Sync everynow and then
  + Way, Way Faster than your normal blog engine.

Well, you won't be able to blog from your phone. (I'm sure could make a text editor with github on board, with some jenkyll is fine...) But ain't nobody wanna work that hard...
I might do a draft engine for mobile eventually tho....

Anyway, I'm a hacker myself, so working on stuffs for two days or so, and now I can blog about them is pretty neat!

# How?
### Or the process

Install your Jekyll following github's guide:

Search for other people's blog using Jekyll. Tons of opensource documents are made with Jekyll as well! Shout out to Ionic and PouchDB


# Wut?
### Or the product

Fully customized jekyll blog
