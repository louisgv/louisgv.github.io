# a127

[Setup and Quick start][9ae81df0]

+ Implemented simple API Call
+ Get and Set pretty cool
+ Note : Restriction of Post and Delete in Production using authentication
+ Note : Look for the sandbox keyword would be fun
+ Parsing JSON is pretty crucial
+ Note : Swagger or YAML is a bitch! Indent-dependent language
+ Note : New line between path entries!


## Remarks:

```  
  - Implementing API as easy as Ionic making a layer
  - I like this guy, 999
  -
```

# Angular and Ionic

+ Implemented 2-way data binding
+ Connect with API

## Remarks

```
  - Good pace overall
  -
```
