# What is LMDE?

LMDE, or Linux Mint Debian Edition, is the slow-rot version of Linux Mint, which turned out to be a Linux distro based off Ubuntu, which in turn branded as the most popular (as in speak-of, not using) distro out there.

# Why LMDE?

## The joy of Debian

Ever excuse yourself out for a cup of coffee, while waiting for the machine to compile some huge ass library? I sure enjoy those moment.

## Updates won't kill, unless you `compile them lib`

As adventurous as I wanted to be when it comes to manually compile shit from source, peaceful time of coding, carefree of the `latest technology`, is surely needed.

## On the Edge, with the scent of Mint

I have tasted all kind of desktop distro e.g Ubuntu, Arch Linux, Fedora, Debian, and Linux Mint. The last two flavors are simply the best. A short review:

```
  + Arch: Simply awesome Wiki. Almost any issue you could ever run into has been documented in the Arch, and reading them is like eating conventional sushi. It's also pretty stable, a monobranch distro. However, using it for a while and I realized how lonely I was.

  + Ubuntu: Simply impossible to Customize. Packages was lacking (2009 when I was still using it), and god damn the update killed me twice. The reason I tried this guy was 9 out of 10 classmate whose name I remembered was using it. (Who was the 10th guy? You guessed it, me).

  + Fedora: Simply slow and nothing... secret. As much as I respect Red Hat for being a mage warrior, Fedora... doesn't bring much value to the table. Hyped as Linus' favorite distro (is it still?), and backed by the technology from the enterprise (?), it bogged my system down so slow I had to kill it. I was testing Fedora with an IBM server station which powered my high school net back then... Quite fun!

  + CentOS: Simply done the job. This guy is pretty stable, and packed with a load of prebuild schema so that setting up a server is not much of a problem! However, the technical level needed to maintain this guy is not very attractive, my TA asked me to tune down the level a lil bit. In the end, he hired someone to get him back his Windows Server 2008... Ho Lee Fuk

  + Debian: Simply stable. This guy chucked down all the library I threw at him, without being dead. You gotta love it when any project you happen to stumbled upon give you a .deb file to crunch on.

  + Linux Mint: Simply elegant. The best distro out there whose desktop is just easy to use and configure. The Cinnamon desktop is the bomb, and who wouldn't love Mint tea with a little bit of Cinnamon?

```

As one could see, I've found the perfect back-end to be Debian and the perfect front-end to be Linuxmint with Cinnamon. LMDE just happen to combine these two, and `BAM` here comes a tea with:

+ Body: Strong and Thick
+ Smell: Fresh minty smell with a kick of spice
+ Flavor: Lightly spicy. The fresh mint just climb up your nose from your throat
+ After-taste: Fresh and cleanse, resulted from the cinnamon
