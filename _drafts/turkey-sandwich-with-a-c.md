So Bogdan was a friend, and last Monday I crashed at his place and we hacked all night. On Tuesday, his sister made us some sandwich.

# Ingredient

- Pesto Herb:
- White bread:
- Cheese:

# Aroma

- Smell amazing, American Cheese with pesto herb in-between
- The crush was baked with the cheese so you can smell the Crunchiness

# Body

- Since the crust was reversed, the outerlayer is formed of bread filled with pesto and butter.
- Thick, and chewy. 4-5 chews to swallow.
- The Crust layer was thin, however the turkey and cheese layer made up for it. Also the middle was the bread crumb, also help in thickenning the body.
- 4 layer of "crust" is a cool.

# Crunchiness

- Butter spread with pesto on the inner layer made this dish not very crunchy.
- Doesn't make the "Crack" sound
- It does make the "Krack" sound tho...

# Flavor

- Pesto with American cheese aroused a Greek kind of flavor
- Node of grass
- Node of wheat grass
- Node of very light milk

# After-taste

- The herb stuck, result of butter and some garlic?
- Although there was not much garlic flavor, the after taste does somehow arouse it... pretty strange.

# Overall, great job!
