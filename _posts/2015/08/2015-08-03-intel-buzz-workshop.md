@IntelSoftware @IntelGaming #gamedev @hubsea #buzzworkshop

# Unreal Panel

### Main point:
```
+ Oculus and Unreal are close friend (Facebook <3 Epic)

+ Unreal embraces the die-hard technical dev

+ Good platform to talk optimization

```

### Thinking:

```
+ The VR industry is being pushed.

+ VR business focusing on CAD is the million bucks

+ Unreal is the way to go for real-world problem, approaching photo-realisztic etc...
```

### Valuation:

```
RealBiz + Optima + VR <-> Unreal
```

If you have a real-world business that is not a game, that is related to VR, and you want extreme optimization, look no further and just get Unreal. The 5% equity is very much worth it.

# Unity Panel

### Main Point:

```
+ Hololen and Unity are close friends (Microsoft <3 Unity)

+ Extremely easy to make and ship your game MVP.

+ There's a Percentage scale in Unity???
```

### Thinking:

```
+ Unity is a good platform for game MVP and game in general

+ AAA game with Unity will suffer down the road due to limitation in what can be optimized out-of-the-box (ootb). It is achievable, but not very straightforward.

+ For things like Hololen and fun, Unity should be considered.
```

### Valuation:

```
  How Tolerable is your ad?
```

Great quote from the speaker that speak for itself. The UX of the ad need to be designed such that there is zero annoyances, fit the flow, and engages user with the game

```
  Fun + Quick + Easy = Unity
```

Unity is a very simle to use platform that can be very powerful when it comes to simple contents that need a quick magic cast to be brought to life. The VR aspect of Unity with the hololen is simply more added-fun that has some value but not much.

Using Unity for  real-world problem is fine as well, but performance-wise and technically-wise, meh.

### Optimization

[Platform statistic from Unity](http://hwstats.unity3d.com/)

```
  Unity does not convert geometry
```

Some option is used to optimize shader. But without a shader editor, Unity looks like a clumsy shady platform.

# Intel Panel

### Main:
```
+ Intel's INDE GPA

+ Host/Target Architecture

+ Analyzers
```

+ Might wanna test this analyzer with Fractal

# How to start and launch a game

```
  Distribution is the most important concept in launching
```

```
  On desktop, the product is a solid one time product (with DLC of course)

  In Mobile, the product is a living ecosystem
```

```
  - Have something to throw against the wall
```

### How much resources are needed:

+ 2 years life circle
+ Console/PC game also need upgrade
+ 3rd party game is less risk or more risk?
+ MVP more faster
+ 9 months before showing to market

> A mid-core to download something for free is $15

+ MVP -> Soft-launch (within thriving environment) -> Global Launch

+ $3 for a user <- user acquisation
+ Extra month of burn
+ Have the right number before release

+ Fanbase
+ Target energy
+ All show up in one day and get it

+ Bullshit: Premium Title: Generate Buzz
+ Lots of Effort, most buzz ever
+ The revenue that game generated is lower than half a day of casino

```
Kickstarter is Tons of Work
```

+ How you pitch, the path you take, economic.
+ **Company** versus **project** or **product** based investment.

+ Cloud-share offering, micro-share
+ $3 for an user to get back $15 each user <- revenue in $12
+ The more and the quicker found, by using $
+ Traffic node and social aspect

```
  How quickly do you want to move? How much risk do you want to take?
```
