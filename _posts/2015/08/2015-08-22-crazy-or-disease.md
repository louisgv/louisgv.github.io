```
Call him A.

```

Bus arrived, get on bus. On the bus, A yielded something that ended with "the cops." Verb related to the incident: "cut."

Next to A on the left, black guy, saggy pant, rugged clothing, headphone. Right feet placed in front of A.

```
Call him B.

D got C on the bus, and tried to have a conversation with A. A kept making a scene by blocking the bus entrance, avoiding B and the rest of bus rider to enter.

5 minutes...
B got on the bus through D, and A was still making a scene. The other bus rider after C has left.

#### 9 minutes
People called A aggressive. D and A was arguing. B took a seat behind C.
