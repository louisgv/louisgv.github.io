# Pre-increment vs Post-increment
## ++i vs i++
i++ is essentially more efficient when it comes to dealing with array indexes, as it includes the 0 as the first index.

For example, if i = 0, i++ will return 0, and the next call to i will show i has indeed been incremented. Try the above commands in your js console:

```
i = 0
i++ // Print 0
i   // Print 1
```

++i is theoretically faster than i++ since all it does is incrementing i without a temporary variable to store the next value of i. Thus, it could be used for example, when one would like to have a faster for loop.

```
i = 0
++i // Print 1
i   // Print 1
```

# The tadpole operator
## -~i && ~-i
A tricky operator using the ~ operator to add. A simple math equation show it is equivalent to i+1 and i-1 respectively. A better way to look at these, is as the MS guy have said:

-~i is a tadpole swimming toward the i, thus increase i by 1 ~-i is a tadpole swimming away from i, thus decrease i by 1

Do not use it stacked, as it will result in unecessary complex thing. On the other hand, codes that has just letter and 0s is simply art

# How to traverse forward and backward in one line of code
For example, given an index inside an array. If one need to get the index ahead and the index before in just one line of code, what should one do?

Here are the answers:

```
i = 0
j = ~-i++ // j==-1 && i==1
---------
j = -~i-- // j==1  && i==-1
```
